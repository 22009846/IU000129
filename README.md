This blog begins by describing the work I performed on the week beginning on Monday 3 July.
However, it is worth noting that I began the process of working on my thesis several weeks prior.
I spent time exploring a variety of ideas for my final project, selecting and refining my idea of choice,
formally establishing a structure for my thesis (presented in a file I uploaded [here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/94HEG1AN6C#7yIxd1q3Rsu4)),
and drafting a work schedule (available for download [here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/58XGFKX794#pSrJ1wK8tgW3)).
All with the help of my supervisor, of course.
This side of my work is not discussed in depth here as it was fairly informal and unsystematic, and thus difficult to document.

At the time of writing, I have not yet started to write my thesis, but I imagine it will be helpful for those reading this blog on or after Saturday 4 November to read the thesis first
in order to contextualise the documentation presented hereafter.

It is my intention, as of 9 July, to write a blog entry on or around the end of every block in my work schedule (which can be found by following the aforementioned link).
(Note that the oral project report is not accounted for in the schedule as I forgot about it while planning my work, but I expect to get it done fairly quickly in the week preceding the
submission date.)

# Monday 3 Julyâ€“Sunday 9 July

I had planned to establish a fairly comprehensive preliminary reference list this week, but encountered two unexpected challenges which limited the number of resources I ended up gathering.
First, some of the topics I intended to review turned out not to have much literature covering them, which led me to spend more time than I had anticipated researching them.
I also came across a large number of outdated resources (dating back to years preceding 2010), which I chose not to include in my reference list as the specific subjects they pertained to
required up-to-date information.
On the other hand, some of the topics I researched had an overwhelming amount of literature associated with them, which led to an extensive process of filtering out irrelevant material.
These two issues combined caused me only to compile a limited list of references, far from what I had planned.

These challenges are by no means unusual, and I have dealt with them on numerous occasions in the past.
However, the reason they caught me off guard is that I had performed a preliminary search to estimate how long I would need to establish the preliminary reference list,
and my estimate turned out not to be accurate.

Nonetheless, I am not worried about this since my schedule has enough slack to allow for delays.
Furthermore, I can always find more references as I write a given section of my thesis, at which point the relevant subject or subjects will be fresh in my mind, thus enabling me to find
quality material at a faster rate.
