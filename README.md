This blog begins by describing the work I performed on the week beginning on Monday 3 July.
However, it is worth noting that I began the process of working on my thesis several weeks prior.
I spent time exploring a variety of ideas for my final project, selecting and refining my idea of choice,
formally establishing a structure for my thesis (presented in a file I uploaded [here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/94HEG1AN6C#7yIxd1q3Rsu4)),
and drafting a work schedule (available for download [here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/58XGFKX794#pSrJ1wK8tgW3)).
All with the help of my supervisor, of course.
This side of my work is not discussed in depth here as it was fairly informal and unsystematic, and thus difficult to document.

At the time of writing, I have not yet started to write my thesis, but I imagine it will be helpful for those reading this blog on or after Saturday 4 November to read the thesis first
in order to contextualise the documentation presented hereafter.

It is my intention, as of 9 July, to write a blog entry on or around the end of every block in my work schedule (which can be found by following the aforementioned link).
(Note that the oral project report is not accounted for in the schedule as I forgot about it while planning my work, but I expect to get it done fairly quickly in the week preceding the
submission date.)

# Monday 3 July–Sunday 9 July

I had planned to establish a fairly comprehensive preliminary reference list this week, but encountered two unexpected challenges which limited the number of resources I ended up gathering.
First, some of the topics I intended to review turned out not to have much literature covering them, which led me to spend more time than I had anticipated researching them.
I also came across a large number of outdated resources (dating back to years preceding 2010), which I chose not to include in my reference list as the specific subjects they pertained to
required up-to-date information.
On the other hand, some of the topics I researched had an overwhelming amount of literature associated with them, which led to an extensive process of filtering out irrelevant material.
These two issues combined caused me only to compile a limited list of references, far from what I had planned.

These challenges are by no means unusual, and I have dealt with them on numerous occasions in the past.
However, the reason they caught me off guard is that I had performed a preliminary search to estimate how long I would need to establish the preliminary reference list,
and my estimate turned out not to be accurate.

Nonetheless, I am not worried about this since my schedule has enough slack to allow for delays.
Furthermore, I can always find more references as I write a given section of my thesis, at which point the relevant subject or subjects will be fresh in my mind, thus enabling me to find
quality material at a faster rate.

# Monday 10 July–Saturday 22 July

Writing my draft introduction took a week longer than expected, but for good reason. I set out to write around 300 words, but ended up drawing from a deep well of impromptu inspiration and writing 1920 words, referencing around three times as many sources than I had planned. In this draft, I attempt to address the following topics:

* What subjects I cover in my thesis
* Why these subjects are important
* Who the thesis was written for
* My objectives for readers

This is only a draft, and as such, it is likely to be refined and modified over time. However, I am quite pleased with it as it is.

# Monday 17 July - Saturday 19 August

I am writing this blog entry in a very belated fashion, after going on holiday with limited availability and subsequently encountering unexpected delays. However, I am now back on schedule and working to pick up the pace of my work. The sections I have written thus far following the introduction of my thesis have matched the word count I expected, and at times exceeded the quality I had anticipated. As the subjects I was writing about all fell under the umbrella of art, I found highly varied and often conflicting opinions among authors (as is often the case with these kinds of subjects), and had to spend much time considering which authors had credibility and which hadn't. For example, many of the conflicting sources I found were commercial in nature (written by for-profit organisations), and thus may have been biased due to vested interests. In order to make my thesis accurate and impartial, I had to seek more acedemic sources, which was sometimes difficult since many scholars in the field of art write in an esoteric and convoluted style. Regardless, all went well in the end.

# Sunday 20 August–Sunday 5 November: "Mega Entry" (In Revision)

It has been long since I last wrote a blog entry due to a number of unforeseeable circumstances. On one hand, I experienced mental health-related delays (for which UAL’s disability service, with which I am registered, provided assistance). On the other hand, I caught COVID-19 for some time, further delaying my work. In addition, I experienced practical delays related to the physical project I have been working on (such as seemingly never-drying spray paint and burning electronic components). Despite these delays and irregularities, I have still been able to produce a fair amount of what I consider to be high-quality work. My thesis currently contains 7,518 words and 69 references, and I plan to bring it up to roughly 10,000 words along with a few additional references. Following is a summary of the work I have completed since my last entry, along with some pictures of my work.

Over a period of about a month directly following my last entry, I worked on the literature review of my thesis, whose length I planned to make up about half of the entire thesis. It ended up being 4,592 words long (though this may still change), which I was satisfied with. The primary challenge involved in writing the literature review was selecting the most suitable sources, as many of them conflicted with each other and were written by authors with starkly different levels of authority. For example, some sources came from little known commercial authors (e.g., corporate entities), while others were written by esteemed academics. That is not to say, however, that the former is less valid than the latter, and this is where the challenge lies. Academics in the field of art generally seem to write broadly and share opinions that may not register or resonate with a general audience, while commercial authors tend to write more “matter-of-factly” but without offering much depth. The first problem I faced when confronted with commercial and academic sources related to a specific passage was to select the ones that were most appropriate (as selecting all of them every time would have resulted in an exceedingly long thesis with unnecessary depth in parts that did not warrant it). The second problem occurred when two or more such sources contradicted each other, and I was left to investigate which of the authors “made most sense” in the context of my thesis specifically. The research process I went through to solve this problem involved a comparison with as many other sources as possible, as well as a number of brainstorming sessions and conversations to check whether selecting one over the other may result in bias (in which case I would have no choice but to somehow include both). I must apologise at this stage for not having an specific examples, but readers are reminded that due to complications I was unable to keep a meticulous record of my work’s progress.

After finishing my literature review, I started working on the physical project of my thesis. As mentioned at the beginning of this short blog, it may be more helpful for readers to first go through the final thesis and the carry on reading this entry afterwards. I started by modelling the structure on Autodesk Fusion 360, as shown below. (The image below only shows the main body of the structure but all printed parts were modelled using the same software.) Along with the—partial—image of the 3D model is a photograph of the printed sculpture while being painted

My original plan for painting the main 3D-printed body was the following:

1.	Sand a single flat surface (face) of the structure.
2.	Spray a layer of primer on the surface.
3.	Gently sand the primed surface.
4.	Repeat steps 2 and 3 twice more.
5.	Spray three coats of black paint on the surface.
6.	Spray three coats of chrome paint on the surface.

I tried this and let the paint dry for two days. However, when I picked up the sculpture, the paint was not dry and I ruined it with fingerprints, so I applied an additional coat of chrome paint and let it dry for five days. When I returned to pick it up, the same thing happened, resulting in a week-long delay. I am still in the process of painting the structure, though with more of a haphazard approach (involving a fair amount of improvisation, and thus being difficult to describe).

In parallel with these activities, I worked on the electronic circuitry, shown below. Following is a description of the various interconnected circuits taken directly from the draft of my thesis.

```↑ Testing and Maintenance Circuit for ESP8266 Thing```

*There are two clusters of solar panels, one on each side of the sculpture. On one side, the panels are connected in series and power the water pump through a simple voltage regulator circuit. On the other side, they are connected in parallel and power a SparkFun ESP8266 Thing—the “brain” of the sculpture. The ESP8266 Thing reads the soil humidity through a hygrometer, and acts as an “on/off switch” for the pump via an electronic switch circuit. The pipe that connects the “back-end” system (electronic and mechanical components) to the inside of the sculpture enters the sculpture through an opening on the back. The system is hidden away some distance behind the sculpture for cosmetic purposes. There are a number of additional components shown in Figure 11, which displays the bare circuitry behind the sculpture. These additional components are there for testing and maintenance purposes, and are not necessary for the proper functioning of the device. They were left for potential future repairs and upgrades.*

**This description depicts the expected final form of the system, which has not yet been completed.**

The “additional components” in question are primarily used to upload code to the ESP8266 Thing, as it normally requires an FTDI controller which I did not have. I therefore had to built a contraption centred around an Arduino Nano to upload the code by proxy (I myself am uncertain about how exactly it works, but I was able to build it by combining what I learned from a handful of online tutorials).

The solar panels do not yet power anything; the ESP8266 Thing and its “support system” are powered by a USB cable, and the voltage regulator circuit powering the pump is powered by two 9 volt batteries. This last part warrants further comments, as it many challenges arose from this part of the system.

When the sculpture and its underlying systems are completed, the solar panels connected to the voltage regulator circuit powering the pump will output a current of 25mA, as per the specifications of the solar panels. However, when testing the system, I did not have the necessary hardware to emulate such a current. I first tried to use an AC to DC converter I owned from a previous project, but the current it generated was far too high and burned the Zener diode used in the circuit. I then switched to two 9 volt batteries, but the diode burned again. I wanted to purchase a diode with the same voltage specifications as the one I used but with a capacity to handle a higher wattage, but was unable to find one, so I ended up purchasing the closest thing I could find (12V instead of 11V). As a result, the testing circuit outputs a slightly higher voltage than that which the pump is rated to handle (its operating range is 6-12V), but it is able to tolerate the difference.
